# MortgageP
The package has one function that returns an amortization table that lists monthly payment on a mortgage
 loan based on a loan amount, duration of loan in years, and annual interest rate. The table will
 provide the breakdown of the payment by how much is allocated to interest and the loan principal.
 It will also list the loan balance for each month.
